OctoLinker is the easiest and best way to navigate between files and projects on GitHub. It turns language-specific statements like include, require or import into links. It supports a variety of languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, Go, PHP, JAVA and more. It works with package.json as well as with Gemfiles.

How does it work?

OctoLinker reads the source code you're currently viewing straight from the browser. 

No source code will ever be sent to a server! Your source code stays in your browser. 

Based on the file type, OctoLinker invokes a plugin which then executes a regular expression on the source code to find import statements.

Relative file references are resolved through the GitHub tree API in your browser. External dependencies are resolved using the OctoLinker API (http://github.com/octoLinker/api).

Only the name of a dependency along with the registry type is sent to this service.

Supported tools and languages:

composer, CSS, Deno, docker, dotnet, go, Haskell, Homebrew, HTML, Java, JavaScript, less, nodejs, npm, Paket, PHP, python, Rlang, Ruby, RubyGems, Rust, Sass, TypeScript, Vim, .Net
