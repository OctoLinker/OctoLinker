OctoLinker is a browser extension for GitHub, that turns language-specific statements like include require or import into links.

OctoLinker reads the source code you're currently viewing straight from the browser or, in some cases, using the GitHub API.

No source code will ever be sent to a server! Your source code stays in your browser.

Based on the file type, OctoLinker invokes a plugin which then executes a regular expression on the source code to find import statements.

Relative file references are resolved through the GitHub tree API in your browser. External dependencies are resolved using the OctoLinker API.

Only the name of a dependency along with the registry type is sent to this service.
