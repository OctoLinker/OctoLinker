# What is OctoLinker?

First of all, it's a browser extension. It's currently only available on Chrome. Once installed, it allows you to navigate through projects on GitHub.com efficiently.

Most projects consist of many files and third party dependencies. Files are referencing other files and / or dependencies by language specific statements like `include` or `require`. Dependencies are most likely declared in a file called manifest e.g. `package.json` or `Gemfile`. The OctoLinker browser extensions makes theses references clickable. No more copy and search.

# Install

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octo-linker/jlmafbaeoofdegohdhinkhilhclaklkp).
