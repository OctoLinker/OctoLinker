> Browser extension for GitHub.com

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-url]][daviddm-image]

This Google Chrome extension allows you to navigate across files and packages on GitHub.com with ease. It works really well for JavaScript e.g. `package.json` `bower.json` `ES2015 import` and good old `CommonJS` statements. Also PHP `composer.json` is supported. Many [other languages](https://github.com/octo-linker/chrome-extension/labels/Add%20support) will be added soon.
